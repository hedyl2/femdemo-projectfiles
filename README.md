# femdemo projectfiles
 
Hello. Thank you for caring enough to download this resource. Long rant incoming, stop reading if you don't care.

Truthfully I'm amazed at how receptive people were to this little hobby project of mine. Every time I see a new like 
or comment on the WIP page I feel a bit more guilty for abandoning it. I put it off for a while with intention to 
"eventually" get back to it but a lot of things have stopped me and people are tired of waiting, I'm sure, so I just
made my resources public.

I have been a neglectful parent to this mod and this may remain the case for the forseeable future. There's a couple 
reasons for this; first and foremost is that i wanted proper gibs for the retail TF2 and for some unholy reason the
party gibs are stuck on no matter what I do in my game. I've tried several console cvars, tried reinstalling, deleting my configs,
disabling steam cloud, nothing works. So because of that i wasn't able to test gibs. Second reason is because the mod
sucks! 

I'm being dramatic, it's obviously not that bad but there's a lot of room for improvement. For one, I think her design 
could use some work. I don't like her face, especially around the mouth. It looks like a noodle when she smiles.
I also made it with smd rather than DMX which was a big mistake for changing facial stuff later down the line.
Her hair isn't the best either and I completely screwed the pooch on the specular/phong map because I had no idea what 
I was doing at the time.

Then, of course, there's the issue of there being way too many cosmetics for one person to refit. You'll notice my half
measures to refit some of them in the files. So, explore to your heart's content, and like all of my mods, this one's
free to use, just don't paywall it and make sure to credit me for whatever you use it for.
